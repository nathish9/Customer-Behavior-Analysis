# Customer-Behavior-Analysis
This project focuses on understanding customer purchasing patterns and behavior using data analytics. The dataset was processed and analyzed using Python, where exploratory data analysis (EDA) was carried out to clean and prepare the data. PostgreSQL was used for structured data storage, querying, segmentation, and retrieving insights using SQL.
